    <p>Everything began in 1992, where Sharetea created their tea drink business in Taipei, Taiwan. Originally, we started off with to-go black tea and pearl milk tea drinks. Over time, we have evolved and expanded and now have locations in 18 countries. Sharetea is in the United States, Canada, UK, Singapore, Australia and 450 stores and counting.</p>

    <p>We have a strong reputation for our fresh, high quality drinks. We make our drinks with ingredients shipped from Taiwan, including our high quality tea leaves. We test our tea leaves and all ingredients to ensure consistency and quality in every drink. We don't use any artificial flavors which ensures the best tasting milk tea. We 100% guarantee all of our products to arrive fresh and tasty!</p>

    <p>Our mission is to introduce to the world, the most authentic Taiwanese tea-drinking culture. ShareTea is the only beverage industry franchise corporation which is recognized as "Taiwan Good Chain Store" by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan for six consecutive years. We were the only pearl milk tea at the 2009 Taipei Deaflympics and the only pearl milk tea brand that represented Taiwanese culture in R.O.C. 100th birthday celebration.</p>

    <p>With a wide variety of drinks ranging from fresh milk, ice blends, yakult, and more and a dozen different toppings, you will certainly find a tea here you love. We are located on Alvarado Niles Road, at the corner of Union Square. We're only a short walk from the Union City Bart so don't forget to grab your favorite tea before your next trip.</p>
